# 2021-snakemake-checkpoints-example

These are example Snakefiles for a blog post on checkpoints in snakemake.

I'll update this README with a link to the blog post; in the meantime,
look at the top of each Snakefile to see run info.

To reset the directory to a clean state, do:
```
rm -f output* .*.touch names.csv
```
